# Mini Web App - Bank Transactions

## Learning Goals
The primary objective of this project is to practice working with React components, props, state management, event handling, and data fetching. By building a mini web app to display recent bank transactions, we aim to reinforce our understanding of these fundamental concepts in React development.

## Introduction
In this project, we'll be developing a React application that showcases a list of recent bank transactions, along with additional features. The instructions provided below will guide us through the process of planning and implementing our app, including designing the user interface, organizing information layout, and more. It's essential to thoroughly plan our app before diving into the coding phase.

## Requirements
For this project, we are required to:

- Create a well-written README file.
- Fetch data from a local server running JSON DB server.

## Project Setup & Pre-requisite Data
1. In our project directory, we'll create a `db.json` file and populate it with data.
2. We'll utilize the provided data for our JSON DB server.
3. Start the backend server using the command: `json-server --watch db.json`.
4. Test the server by visiting the route in the browser: [http://localhost:8001/transactions](http://localhost:8001/transactions).

## Project Setup
Follow these steps to set up our project:

1. Create a new project folder.
2. Establish a new GitHub repository (Ensure it is private).
3. Add our team member as a contributor to the project (only for grading purposes).
4. Commit our changes regularly to the repository.

## Project Guidelines
Our project should adhere to the following guidelines:

### Core Deliverables
As a user, I can:

- View a table displaying all transactions.
- Fill out and submit a form to add a new transaction. The new transaction should appear in the table. Note: New transactions do not need to be persisted to the backend.
- Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.

### Bonus Deliverables
These bonus deliverables are optional but provide an additional challenge:

As a user, I should be able to:

- Sort transactions alphabetically by category or description.
- Delete a transaction, removing it from the table.

## Conclusion
By completing this project, we aim to strengthen our React development skills and gain practical experience in building dynamic web applications. Let's embark on this journey of learning and creation together!
